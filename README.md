## Trying to organize all of the things

I tend to hop from idea to idea, goal to goal... rarely making progress and am easily sidetracked. This leads to periods of burnout and then periods of renewed interest in said goals. With this renewed interest, I don't always stick to the same projects and goals which leaves me with a lot of half-baked, unfinished projects and a lot of half-read books. 

The goal of this app is to create a centralized list of things I am currently focuesed on, specific projects, or goals, each with a relative priority. If I am feeling inspired, I can reference the list and if I reach any milestone, I can record for later reference. 

Why spend thirty seconds writing down ideas in a journal when I can spend a month or two shaving the yak that is building this app?
